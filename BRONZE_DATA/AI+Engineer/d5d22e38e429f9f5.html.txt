 
  Microsoft Azure is at the center of Microsoftâ€™s cloud services strategy and the future of Microsoft. Azure brings together virtualization, compute, storage, authentication, authorization, artificial intelligence and machine learning, media and more to enable anyone to bring their business into the cloud. The Azure Security engineering organization focuses on ensuring that Azure is the most secure platform in the world and delivers a secure experience for millions of users worldwide.
 
 
 
   We are seeking a diligent, insightful, and creative Security Engineer to help discover, diagnose, analyze, quantify, characterize, and drive solutions for the most challenging security problems in Azure through a data-driven, product-driven lens. In this role, you will advance security by working with other Security Engineers, Program and Product Managers, Developers, and business leaders throughout Microsoft to turn individual findings into vulnerability patterns and insights that can be measured and managed through engineering, automation, and other appropriate mitigations. You will help identify the most demanding security problems through original research and data analysis, and help design and deliver practical solutions at scale for select products and services. This role is not confined to any area of technology; rather, you will work up and down the stack, across platforms, operating systems, languages, and frameworks, using your broad security skills to solve problems in unfamiliar domains. 
 
 Responsibilities
 
   Key responsibilities include:
 
 
   Vulnerability discovery and variant hunting. In partnership with others, you will use and apply the best available and most appropriate methodologies, including threat modeling, penetration testing, security design analysis, fuzzing, SAST and DAST, etc. to discover and identify security problems. You will examine chosen target systems in detail, looking for vulnerabilities and weaknesses, performing variant hunting to identify larger patterns, conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis over those patterns, and driving solutions upstream in a data-driven, shift-left fashion.
   Solution design and delivery: You will help design solutions for security problems and partner with service teams and other security stakeholders to ensure rapid adoption of solutions and mitigation of threats from beginning to end.
   Software development: You will prototype and create tools and scanners to automate the discovery and prevention of vulnerabilities across Azure products and services.
   Follow through and closure. You will partner with engineers, product and program managers, and leaders around the company to ensure the successful completion of work to address your findings.
   Threat modeling / Architecture reviews: You will review the design of services from a security perspective to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the architecture, make appropriate recommendations, and guide teams to implement those recommendations.
 
 
 
   We do not expect that any individual knows all the technologies that are in scope for this role, rather we are looking for someone who can quickly translate their technical skills from one domain to another; find, assemble, and inspire the relevant technical experts from across the company; and communicate effectively about technical and business risks to engineering and executive leadership.
