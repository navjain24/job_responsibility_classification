  About the role 
  Dremio's SREs ensure that internal and externally visible services have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement. You will be joining a small team of experienced SREs helping to deliver a world class experience to Dremio Cloud customers. Our systems, like many, are joint-cognitive, made up of both people and software: complex and therefore intrinsically hazardous. We understand and expect that catastrophe is always just around the corner. 
  What you'll be doing 
 
  Drive continuous improvements to our usage of Kubernetes, our Operators, and the GitOps deployment paradigm. 
  Extend our networking, service mesh and Kubernetes systems to support connectivity between GCP, AWS and Azure. 
  Collaborate with Engineering teams to support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, monitoring/alerting, capacity planning, production readiness and service reviews. 
  Help define and instrument Service Level indicators and objectives (SLIs/SLOs) with service owners in the Engineering teams. Develop SLO-based on-call strategies for service owners and their teams. 
  Collaborate within our virtual Observability team: develop and improve observability (tracing, events, metrics, profiling, logging and exceptions) of the Dremio Cloud product. 
  Ability to debug and optimize code written by others and automate routine tasks. You recognize complexity and are familiar with multiple techniques to manage it but recognize the folly in complete rewrites. 
  Evangelize and advocate for resilience engineering and reliability practices across our organization. 
  Scale systems sustainably through automation and evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity. 
  Join an on-call rotation for systems and services that the SRE team owns. 
  Practice sustainable incident response and post-incident investigation analysis. Use techniques developed in and around the Learning from Incidents community. 
  Drive the cultural, technical, and process changes to move towards a true continuous delivery model within the company. 
 
 What we're looking for 
 
  7+ years of relevant experience in the following areas: SRE, DevOps, Distributed Systems, Cloud Operations, Software Engineering. 
  Expertise in Kubernetes, Istio, Terraform, ArgoCD/Flux. 
  Expertise with software defined networking infrastructure: dedicated and partner interconnects, VPNs, BGP. 
  Excellent command of cloud services on GCP/AWS/Azure, CI/CD pipelines. 
  Have moderate-advanced experience in Python/Go, and at least reading knowledge of Java. 
  Interested in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems. 
  Have a systematic problem-solving approach, coupled with strong communication skills and a sense of ownership and drive. 
  Great ability to debug and optimize code and automate routine tasks. 
  Solid background in software development and architecting resilient and reliable applications. 
 
 Bonus points if you have 
 
  Hands-on experience with large-scale production Kubernetes clusters (<=1000 nodes). 
  Developed SLIs/SLOs for production systems. 
  Hands-on experience using Honeycomb for OpenTelemetry trace analysis. 
  Engagement with the Learning from Incidents community. Familiarity with seminal work of Allspaw, Woods, Cook et al. 
 
 What we offer 
 
  Medical, dental and vision insurance 
  401(k) Plan 
  Short term / long term disability and life insurance
