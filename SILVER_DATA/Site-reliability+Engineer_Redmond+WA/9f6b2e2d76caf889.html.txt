22:125:You recognize complexity and are familiar with multiple techniques to manage it but recognize the folly in complete rewrites.
23:101:Evangelize and advocate for resilience engineering and reliability practices across our organization.
24:125:Scale systems sustainably through automation and evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
25:73:Join an on-call rotation for systems and services that the SRE team owns.
26:80:Practice sustainable incident response and post-incident investigation analysis.
27:77:Use techniques developed in and around the Learning from Incidents community.

30:55:Expertise in Kubernetes, Istio, Terraform, ArgoCD/Flux.
31:106:Expertise with software defined networking infrastructure: dedicated and partner interconnects, VPNs, BGP.
32:70:Excellent command of cloud services on GCP/AWS/Azure, CI/CD pipelines.
33:87:Have moderate-advanced experience in Python/Go, and at least reading knowledge of Java.
34:87:Interested in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.

36:68:Great ability to debug and optimize code and automate routine tasks.
37:94:Solid background in software development and architecting resilient and reliable applications.
38:113:Bonus points if you have

39:43:Developed SLIs/SLOs for production systems.
40:69:Hands-on experience using Honeycomb for OpenTelemetry trace analysis.
41:54:Engagement with the Learning from Incidents community.
