21:Ability to debug and optimize code written by others and automate routine tasks.
22:You recognize complexity and are familiar with multiple techniques to manage it but recognize the folly in complete rewrites.
23:Evangelize and advocate for resilience engineering and reliability practices across our organization.
24:Scale systems sustainably through automation and evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
25:Join an on-call rotation for systems and services that the SRE team owns.
26:Practice sustainable incident response and post-incident investigation analysis.
27:Use techniques developed in and around the Learning from Incidents community.
28:Drive the cultural, technical, and process changes to move towards a true continuous delivery model within the company.

  7+ years of relevant experience in the following areas: SRE, DevOps, Distributed Systems, Cloud Operations, Software Engineering.
30:Expertise in Kubernetes, Istio, Terraform, ArgoCD/Flux.
31:Expertise with software defined networking infrastructure: dedicated and partner interconnects, VPNs, BGP.
32:Excellent command of cloud services on GCP/AWS/Azure, CI/CD pipelines.
33:Have moderate-advanced experience in Python/Go, and at least reading knowledge of Java.
34:Interested in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.
35:Have a systematic problem-solving approach, coupled with strong communication skills and a sense of ownership and drive.
36:Great ability to debug and optimize code and automate routine tasks.
37:Solid background in software development and architecting resilient and reliable applications.

  Hands-on experience with large-scale production Kubernetes clusters (<=1000 nodes).
