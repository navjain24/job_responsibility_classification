 About the Role 
 At AstrumU we are focused on our customer’s needs, relying heavily on data for product development, customer engagement, and marketplace optimization. To ensure all these areas are effectively served, we look to DevOps engineers to support the development and operation of software through tools, environments, and practices.
  
  
  We are looking for a candidate who can thrive in a small cross-functional team environment. Successful candidates will possess technical aptitude alongside effective, respectful communication skills. We value quick learners capable of focusing on priority tasks while adequately capturing new tasks as they arise (vs multi-tasking which is inefficient).
  
  
 Specifically, we are looking for a DevOps Engineer to be responsible for underpinning good development and release management processes. This includes managing tools and testing environments, source and artifact management, maintaining development and compliance standards, and creating/supporting Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

  Programming and build (software engineering). You know how to collaborate with others when necessary to review specifications and then use these agreed specifications to design, code, test, and document solutions 
  Service support. You like to solve problems and approach troubleshooting with a logical methodology. 
  Communication: You will have the ability to communicate (written & verbal) complex technical scenarios and situations to a variety of technical & non-technical audiences. 
  Systems design. You can see the forest through the trees to help design effective systems to support business needs. You can produce detailed designs and document your use of required standards, methods, and tools, including prototyping tools where appropriate. You know how to identify and implement appropriate patterns. You can design systems that balance risk/complexity with meaningful outcomes. 
  Systems integration. You can build and test interfaces between systems and can work on more complex integrations as part of a wider team. 
  User focus. You can identify and engage with users or stakeholders to collate user needs evidence. You can identify and define research that fits user needs. You know how to use quantitative and qualitative data about users to turn user focus into outcomes.
