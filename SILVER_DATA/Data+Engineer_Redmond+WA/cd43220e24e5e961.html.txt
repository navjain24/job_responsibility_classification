7:114:Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.
8:84:Engineering culture
  We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude.
9:148:All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers.
10:116:Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players.
11:167:As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
12:134:Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.
13:159:Examples of some of our projects:
  
   We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue.
14:89:We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems.
15:125:We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data.
16:111:To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR.
17:100:The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
18:68:We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event.
19:122:A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees.
20:110:The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming.
21:138:To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant.
22:48:The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob.
23:122:An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records.
24:140:After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot.
25:111:The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
26:220:For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes.
27:68:We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate.
28:113:Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
29:69:The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.
